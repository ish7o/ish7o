- A guy who thinks to omuch about life (that's why I'm sometimes depressed)
- Neovim & Arch BTW üíú

Hi, I'm ishto, a shy nerd, not keen on learning anything, it's just the curiosity that drives me. I know bits of go and python, might write rust if feeling smart. I just hang around, might read Arch Wiki for fun or act like I understand kernel code. At least I'm not a web dev.

Also irl known as Julian

### What I like
- Code in Go, maybe Python, Rust if I'm feeling smart
- Configure Neovim (endlessly)
- Read docs & manga
- Mood based occasional artist
